## Image generation

One use of LLMs that has become popular is image generation. The version of Microsoft Copilot available via the universities can create images. The free version of ChatGPT does not offer full image generation capability but you can try and see what it gives you ðŸ˜€.

Some example prompts:

```{r}
An astronaut standing on the moon looking at Earth.
```

```{r}
A futuristic city with sleek, glass-covered skyscrapers, flying cars zipping through the air, and digital billboards flashing with vibrant colors.
```

```{r}
An illustration of the water cycle, showing evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and collection.
```
